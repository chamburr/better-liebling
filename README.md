# Better Liebling

Better Liebling is a very beautiful and clean Ghost theme, that is very easy and comfortable to use.

This fork is based on the original [Liebling](https://github.com/eddiesigner/liebling) theme. It aims to achieve a more appealing and Medium-like UI design, and adds useful features such as post excerpt and custom footer. Notably, some features were removed and the colour scheme was modified, so a PR would probably have been rejected.

You can find a live demo on my [personal blog](https://blog.chamburr.com).

## Installation

1. Download better-liebling.zip from releases.
2. Upload and activate the theme on your Ghost instance.
